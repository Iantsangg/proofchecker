# Named Theorem Example
# Demonstrates defining and applying theorems

# Define a theorem about positive sums
theorem positive_sum:
  assume a > 0
  assume b > 0
  prove a + b > 0

# Now use the theorem in a proof
assume x > 0
assume y > 0
apply positive_sum

# Use the theorem's conclusion
prove x + y > 0
